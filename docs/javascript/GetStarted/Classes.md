## Overview.

**JavaScript classes** were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) as a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance. Classes are syntactical sugar for the prototypal inheritance model used in JavaScript.

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and behavior into a single unit. An instance of a class is an object that has the properties and methods defined by the class.

## Defining a Class

You can define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class. The class can have a constructor method and other methods defined inside it.

Here's an example of a class definition:

```javascript
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
  get area() {
    return this.calcArea();
  }
  calcArea() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
}
```

## Creating Objects from a Class

To create an object from a class, you use the `new` keyword, followed by the name of the class and any arguments required by the constructor.

```javascript
const myRectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
```

## Inheritance

Classes can also inherit from other classes using the extends keyword. When a class extends another class, it inherits all the properties and methods of the parent class.

```javascript
class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(side) {
    super(side, side);
  }
}
```
