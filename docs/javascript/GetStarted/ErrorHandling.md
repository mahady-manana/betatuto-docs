## Overview.

**Error handling** in JavaScript is the process of identifying, reporting, and resolving errors or exceptions that occur in a program.

JavaScript provides a variety of mechanisms for handling errors, such as `try-catch` blocks and the `throw` statement. By using these tools, developers can catch and handle errors gracefully, preventing crashes and unexpected behavior in their applications.

Effective error handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable JavaScript code.

example:

```javascript
try {
  // code that may cause an error
  const result = calculate(10, 0);
} catch (error) {
  // handle the error
  console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
} finally {
  // execute this code regardless of whether an error is thrown or not
  console.log("Done.");
}

function calculate(num1, num2) {
  if (num2 === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero.");
  }
  return num1 / num2;
}
```
