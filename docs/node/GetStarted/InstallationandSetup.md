## Overview

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, and has become a popular choice for building server-side applications.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing and setting up Node.js on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Node.js, you should have:

- A computer running a supported operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- A command-line interface (CLI) installed on your computer
- Administrator access to install software on your computer (if necessary)

## Installing Node.js

1. Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. Double-click the installer file to begin the installation process.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4. Verify that Node.js has been installed by opening a command prompt or terminal window and typing the following command:

```batch
node -v
```

This command will display the version number of Node.js that is currently installed on your system.

## Setting up Node.js

Once Node.js is installed, you can start using it to run JavaScript code on your computer.

To get started, create a new file with the `.js` extension and add some JavaScript code to it. For example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Save the file, then open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

To run the code in the file, type the following command:

```batch
node filename.js
```

Replace `filename` with the name of your file (without the `.js` extension). This will execute the JavaScript code in the file and display the output in the command prompt or terminal window.

## Congratulations!
You have successfully installed and set up Node.js on your local machine. You can now start exploring the many features and capabilities of this powerful JavaScript runtime.
