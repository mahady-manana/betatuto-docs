## Overview

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which was first introduced by Facebook in 2011 and has since been maintained by a growing community of developers.

## What Is React Component

In React, a component is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates the functionality and appearance of a specific part of a user interface. Components can be combined together to create complex UIs, and can also be reused across different parts of an application.

### Create a React Component

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';


function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React.js</h1>
      <p>A library for building UI.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Here is how React render the element on the page

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Create a Reusable Component

```jsx
// MyComponent.jsx
import React from "react";

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.text}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This component takes in two props, "`title`" and "`text`", and renders them inside a div.

To use this component in another component, you can import it and use it like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent title="Hello React.js" text="Welcome to my app" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code imports the MyComponent component and uses it inside the App component, passing in the "`title`" and "`text`" props.

## What is React State

[React state](/react/reactjs-basics) is an object that holds the data that a component uses to render its UI. When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component and updates the UI to reflect the new state.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

## What is React Hooks

[React Hooks](/react/reactjs-hooks) are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hook is the useState hook, which allows you to add state to a functional component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  function handleChange(event) {
    setName(event.target.value);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // set default state on component mount
    setName("Devs");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

By using React Hooks, functional components can now have state, making them more flexible and powerful. Hooks can also be used to handle other React features such as lifecycle events, context, and more.

React is a powerful and flexible library that has become widely popular among developers. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently, while also minimizing DOM manipulations for improved performance.

## React Versions

The current stable version of React is React 18.

## Notes

- Components: React is all about building reusable UI components. A component is a piece of code that represents a part of the UI, such as a button, a form, or a table.

- State: State refers to the data that a component stores internally. React allows you to update state and re-render the UI based on those changes.

- Props: Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

- Virtual DOM: The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to minimize the number of DOM manipulations and improve performance.
